The project is a simulation of an 
Auto_navigation Drone 
autonomous indoor navigation system using a drone, referred to as an "antonomous UV AV system". Its primary purpose is to test the drone's ability to navigate from a source to a destination while performing 

obstacle avoidance. The system is designed for an indoor environment with an indoor GPS, and its navigation is managed by an 

AI-driven approach. The simulation is developed using 

MATLAB.

Execution and Real-Time Uses

The simulation's execution involves a model-based or code-based approach in MATLAB to systematically test the drone's navigation capabilities. The AI-driven system handles the logic for obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation.

In a real-time scenario, this system could have various practical applications:

Automated Inspection: Drones could autonomously inspect large indoor spaces like warehouses or factories for maintenance issues or inventory management.

Security and Surveillance: The system could patrol buildings autonomously, providing real-time video feeds without the need for constant human supervision.

Logistics and Delivery: Drones could be used for last-mile delivery within large facilities, moving items from one location to another efficiently.
