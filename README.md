The simulation's execution involves a model-based or code-based approach in MATLAB to systematically test the drone's navigation capabilities. The AI-driven system handles the logic for obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation.

In a real-time scenario, this system could have various practical applications:

Automated Inspection: Drones could autonomously inspect large indoor spaces like warehouses or factories for maintenance issues or inventory management.

Security and Surveillance: The system could patrol buildings autonomously, providing real-time video feeds without the need for constant human supervision.

Logistics and Delivery: Drones could be used for last-mile delivery within large facilities, moving items from one location to another efficiently.
